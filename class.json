Possible reasons: The way Google Mail sends data is incompatible with the way I open the data, causing code errors. The email data is too large, causing transmission errors.",

When I analyze data systems, my life experience reminds me of language systems: two languages translate into each other, and occasionally there are translation errors or missing meanings. This is similar to the Gmail codes I've collected: they have some lengthy error codes, possibly due to errors encountered during transmission. So I want to relate to them.",

In the future I will continue to study these and learn more about how to tell stories through visual language.",
